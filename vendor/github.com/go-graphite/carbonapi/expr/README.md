carbonapi: replacement graphite API server
------------------------------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/go-graphite/carbonapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/go-graphite/carbonapi)
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi)

We are using <a href="https://packagecloud.io/"><img alt="Private Maven, RPM, DEB, PyPi and RubyGem Repository | packagecloud" height="46" src="https://packagecloud.io/images/packagecloud-badge.png" width="158" /></a> to host our packages!

CarbonAPI supports a significant subset of graphite functions [see [COMPATIBILITY](COMPATIBILITY.md)].
In our testing it has shown to be 5x-10x faster than requesting data from graphite-web.

For requirements see **Requirements** section below.

Installation
------------

At this moment we are building packages for CentOS 6, CentOS 7, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 16.04. Installation guides are available on packagecloud (see the links below).

Stable versions: [Stable repo](https://packagecloud.io/go-graphite/stable/install)

Autobuilds (master, might be unstable): [Autobuild repo](https://packagecloud.io/go-graphite/autobuilds/install)


General information
-------------------

The only required parameter is the path to a config file. For an example see `carbonapi.example.yaml`

`$ ./carbonapi -config /etc/carbonapi.yaml`

Request metrics will be dumped to graphite if coresponding config options are set,
or if the GRAPHITEHOST/GRAPHITEPORT environment variables are found.

Request data will be stored in memory (default) or in memcache.


Requirements
------------

CarbonAPI uses protobuf-based protocol to talk with underlying storages. For current version the compatibility list is:

1. [carbonzipper](https://github.com/go-graphite/carbonzipper) >= 0.50
2. [go-carbon](https://github.com/lomik/go-carbon) >= 0.9.0 (Note: you need to enable carbonserver in go-carbon). Limitations: /info handler won't work properly
3. [carbonserver](https://github.com/grobian/carbonserver)@master (Note: you should probably switch to go-carbon in that case). Limitations: /info handler won't work properly
4. [graphite-clickhouse](https://github.com/lomik/graphite-clickhouse) any. That's alternative storage that doesn't use Whisper. Limitations: /info handler won't work properly.
5. [carbonapi](https://github.com/go-graphite/carbonapi) >= 0.5. Note: we are not sure if there is any point in running carbonapi over carbonapi at this moment.

OSX Build Notes
---------------
Some additional steps may be needed to build carbonapi with cairo rendering on MacOSX.

Install cairo:

```
$ brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz

$ brew install cairo --with-x11
```
